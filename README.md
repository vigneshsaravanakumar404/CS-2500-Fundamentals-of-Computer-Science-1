## 📚 Course Overview

**CS 2500** introduces the fundamental ideas of computing and the principles of programming. The course discusses a systematic approach to word problems, including analytic reading, synthesis, goal setting, planning, plan execution, and testing. It presents several models of computing, starting from nothing more than expression evaluation in the spirit of high school algebra. This course assumes no prior programming experience; therefore, it is suitable for first-year students—majors and nonmajors alike—who wish to explore the intellectual ideas in the discipline.
